# European Football Match Officials' Decisions

This project aims to examine football match data from European league matches and determine how influential referees' decisions are on the outcome of the match. These decisions include detecting fouls, cards, free kicks, corners, off-sides, out-of-bounds, usage of VAR, etc. 

These positions can often make-or-break a team's chances of scoring, and it is important to demonstrate this for reliability purposes and tactical purposes. If match officials are influential and make incorrect calls, this could hurt a team significantly. If match officials are influential with their awarding of set-pieces, a manager could see this as an opportunity to capitalize by focusing their team on these set-pieces.

This topic has been discussed in house-holds, bars, stadiums, and board-meetings for quite some time now. It would be valuable to see more of an analytical approach to this question, and understand the implications that could arise.
